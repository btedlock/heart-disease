# ðŸ«€ End-to-End Heart Disease Classification

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to classify heart disease using clinical data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and performance comparison using multiple classification algorithms.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Predict the presence of heart disease using patient clinical features
- Evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and model tuning
- Visualize important trends and results throughout the pipeline

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- XGBoost Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Voting Classifier (Ensemble)

## ðŸ“Š Features Used

Some of the key input features include:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Max heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression and slope
- Number of major vessels
- Thalassemia status

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

The notebook includes:

- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature importance plots
- ROC curves
- Pairplots and histograms for EDA

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook
3. Run all cells in order
4. Observe outputs, visualizations, and model performance comparisons

## ðŸ“š Dataset

The dataset used is a version of the **Cleveland Heart Disease** dataset, available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for binary classification problems, demonstrating model comparison and best practices in data preprocessing and evaluation. The ensemble Voting Classifier shows strong performance and robustness across metrics.
